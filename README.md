CPAN and meta::cpan interlinks
==============================

A Greasemonkey Add-On that adds CPAN links to meta::cpan and vice-versa

## DESCRIPTION

Some people prefer CPAN, some prefer meta::cpan. Often you end up on the wrong
site. This Greasemonkey script adds links to meta::cpan on every POD page rendered
to hop over to CPAN, if that is what you like better. In case you prefer meta::cpan,
this script does the same on CPAN, vice-versa.
